# Transparent AI System for Patient Safety and Drug Safety Monitoring

## Overview
This project predicts drug safety risk using machine learning and explains the prediction
using transparent AI techniques. Unlike black-box models, this system helps users
understand why a drug is considered risky, improving trust and patient safety.

---

## Problem Statement
Many AI healthcare systems provide predictions without explanations.
In medical applications, lack of transparency can be dangerous.
This project focuses on explainable and trustworthy AI for drug safety.

---

## Solution
- Predicts drug risk using machine learning
- Explains model decisions using feature importance
- Supports safer clinical decision-making

---

## Dataset
Patient adverse drug reaction dataset  
File: patient_adverse_drug_reactions.csv

---

## ML Models Used
- Random Forest Classifier
- Logistic Regression (baseline)

---

## Explainable AI
The system explains:
- Important features affecting drug risk
- Reasons behind each prediction

---

## Technologies Used
Python  
Pandas  
NumPy  
Scikit-learn  
SHAP  

---
